<p>Hyenas, or hyaenas are feliform carnivoran mammals belonging to the family Hyaenidae.[1] With just four extant species 
    it is the fifth-smallest family in the Carnivora and one of the smallest in the class Mammalia.[2] 
    Despite their low diversity, hyenas are unique and vital components of most African ecosystems.[3]
    <br/>
    Although phylogenetically closer to felines and viverrids, as part of suborder Feliformia, hyenas are 
    behaviourally and morphologically similar to canids in several elements due to convergent evolution: 
    both hyenas and canines are non-arboreal, cursorial hunters that catch prey with their teeth rather than 
    claws. Both eat food quickly and may store it, and their calloused feet with large, blunt, nonretractable 
    claws are adapted for running and making sharp turns. However, hyenas' grooming, scent marking, defecation 
    habits, mating and parental behavior are consistent with the behavior of other feliforms.[4]
