<p>Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds from the
    order Sphenisciformes of thefamily Spheniscidae.[4] They
    live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only
    one species, the Galápagos penguin, is found north of
    the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the ocean
    water, penguins have countershaded dark and white
    plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins
    feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea
    life which they catch with their bills and swallow whole
    while swimming. A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful
    jaws to grip slippery prey.[5] They spend about half of
    their lives on land and the other half in the sea. The 
    largest living species is the emperor penguin 
    (Aptenodytes forsteri):[6] on average, adults are about 
    1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb). The 
    smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin 
    (Eudyptula minor), also known as the fairy penguin, 
    which stands around 30–33 cm (12–13 in) tall and weighs 
    1.2–1.3 kg (2.6–2.9 lb).[7] Today, larger penguins 
    generally inhabit colder regions, and smaller penguins 
    inhabit regions with temperate or tropical climates. 
    Some prehistoric penguin species were enormous: as tall 
    or heavy as an adult human. There was a great diversity 
    of species in subantarctic regions, and at least one 
    giant species in a region around 2,000 km south of the 
    equator 35 mya, during the Late Eocene, a climate 
    decidedly warmer than today.[8]</p>
