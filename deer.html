    A deer or true deer is a hoofed ruminant 
    mammal of the family Cervidae. The two main groups of 
    deer are the Cervinae, including muntjac, elk (wapiti), 
    red deer, and fallow deer; and the Capreolinae, including 
    reindeer (caribou), white-tailed deer, roe deer, and moose. 
    Male deer of all species (except the water deer), as well as 
    female reindeer, grow and shed new antlers each year. In this, 
    they differ from permanently horned antelope, which are part of 
    a different family (Bovidae) within the same order of even-toed 
    ungulates (Artiodactyla).<br/>
    The musk deer (Moschidae) of Asia and chevrotains (Tragulidae) 
    of tropical African and Asian forests are separate families 
    that are also in the ruminant clade Ruminantia; they are not 
    especially closely related to Cervidae.
