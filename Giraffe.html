    The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial 
    animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa 
    camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant 
    species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements. 
    Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.<br/>
    The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, 
    and its spotted coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, 
    the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to 
    Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of 
    woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.
